            Article content is contained in this paragraph.
            The "article" tag specifies that all the content within it is separate and self-contained content.
            This means that all content inside an "article" tag should be able to be distributed on its own.
        </p>
    </article>

    <details>
        <summary>The summary tag adds context to the outside of the details widget</summary>
        The details element creates a widget that hides extra information until the widget is opened.
    </details>

    <p>
        The "time" tag allows you to specify metadata such as exact times when writing a time, like this:
        <time datetime="2018-07-07">July 7, 2018</time>
    </p>
